= Lazydoc[http://tap.rubyforge.org/lazydoc]

Lazydoc lazily pulls documentation out of source files and makes it
available in code through lazy attributes.  Lazydoc is used by the
Tap[http://tap.rubyforge.org] framework.

== Description

Lazydoc allows you to define lazy attributes that act as markers for
documentation in a source file.  When you call the lazy attribute,
Lazydoc pulls out the documentation:

  # Sample::key <value>
  # This is the comment content.  A content
  # string can span multiple lines...
  class Sample
    extend Lazydoc::Attributes
    lazy_attr :key
  end
  
  comment = Sample::key
  comment.value      # => "<value>"
  comment.comment    # => "This is the comment content.  A content string can span multiple lines..."

Comments support wrapping, allowing for easy presentation:

  "\n#{'.' * 30}\n" + comment.wrap(30) + "\n#{'.' * 30}\n"
  # => %q{
  # ..............................
  # This is the comment content.
  # A content string can span
  # multiple lines...
  # ..............................
  # }

In addition, Lazydoc provides helpers to register individual lines
of code, particularly method definitions:

  class Helpers
    extend Lazydoc::Attributes
    
    register_method___
    # method_one is registered by the helper
    def method_one(a, b='str', &c)
    end
    
    # register_caller will register the line
    # that *calls* method_two
    def method_two
      Lazydoc.register_caller
    end
  end
  
  # *THIS* is the line that gets
  # registered by method_two
  Helpers.new.method_two
  
  doc = Helpers.lazydoc
  doc.resolve
  
  comment = doc.comments[0]
  comment.method_name        # => "method_one"
  comment.arguments          # => ["a", "b='str'", "&c"]
  comment.to_s               # => "method_one is registered by the helper"
  
  comment = doc.comments[1]
  comment.subject            # => "Helpers.new.method_two"
  comment.to_s               # => "*THIS* is the line that gets registered by method_two"

== Usage

Lazydoc can find two types of documentation, constant attributes and code
comments, which correspond to lazy attributes and the lines of code 
registered by helpers, respectively.

=== Constant Attributes

Constant attributes are like constants in Ruby, but with an extra 'key' 
that must consist of only lowercase letters and/or underscores.  For 
example, these are constant attributes:

  # Const::Name::key
  # Const::Name::key_with_underscores
  # ::key

While these are not:

  # Const::Name::Key
  # Const::Name::key2
  # Const::Name::k@y

Lazydoc parses a Lazydoc::Comment for each constant attribute by using the 
remainder of the line as a value (ie subject) and scanning down for content.
Scanning continues until a non-comment line, an end key, or a new attribute
is reached; the comment is then stored by constant name and key.

  str = %Q{
  # Const::Name::key value for key
  # comment for key
  # parsed until a 
  # non-comment line

  # Const::Name::another value for another
  # comment for another
  # parsed to an end key
  # Const::Name::another-
  #
  # ignored comment
  }

  doc = Lazydoc::Document.new
  doc.resolve(str)

  doc.summarize {|c| [c.value, c.comment] } 
  # => {
  # 'Const::Name' => {
  #   'key' =>     ['value for key', 'comment for key parsed until a non-comment line'],
  #   'another' => ['value for another', 'comment for another parsed to an end key']}
  # }

Constant attributes are only parsed from commented lines.  To turn off
attribute parsing for a section of documentation, use start/stop keys:

  str = %Q{
  Const::Name::not_parsed

  # :::-
  # Const::Name::not_parsed
  # :::+
  # Const::Name::parsed value
  }

  doc = Lazydoc::Document.new
  doc.resolve(str)
  doc.summarize {|comment| comment.value }   # => {'Const::Name' => {'parsed' => 'value'}}

To hide attributes from RDoc, make use of the RDoc <tt>:startdoc:</tt> 
document modifier like this (note that spaces are added to prevent RDoc
from hiding the example):

  # :start doc::Const::Name::one hidden in RDoc
  # * This line is visible in RDoc.
  # :start doc::Const::Name::one-
  # 
  #-- 
  # Const::Name::two
  # You can hide attribute comments like this.
  # Const::Name::two-
  #++
  #
  # * This line is also visible in RDoc.

As a side note, 'Const::Name::key' is not a reference to the 'key' 
constant (that would be invalid).  In *very* idiomatic ruby
'Const::Name::key' is equivalent to the method call 'Const::Name.key'.

=== Code Comments

Code comments are lines registered for parsing if and when a Lazydoc gets 
resolved. Unlike constant attributes, the registered line is the comment
subject (ie value) and contents are parsed up from it (basically mimicking
the behavior of RDoc).

  str = %Q{
  # comment lines for
  # the method
  def method
  end

  # as in RDoc, the comment can be
  # separated from the method

  def another_method
  end
  }

  doc = Lazydoc::Document.new
  doc.register(3)
  doc.register(9)
  doc.resolve(str)

  doc.comments.collect {|c| [c.subject, c.comment] } 
  # => [
  # ['def method', 'comment lines for the method'],
  # ['def another_method', 'as in RDoc, the comment can be separated from the method']]

Comments may be registered to specific line numbers, or with a Proc or
Regexp that will determine the line number during resolution.  In the case
of a Regexp, the first matching line is used; Procs receive an array of
lines and should return the line number that should be used.  See 
{Comment#resolve}[link://classes/Lazydoc/Comment.html] for more details.
