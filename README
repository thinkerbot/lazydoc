= Lazydoc[http://tap.rubyforge.org/lazydoc]

Lazydoc lazily pulls documentation out of source files and makes it
available in code through lazy attributes.  Lazydoc is used by the
Tap[http://tap.rubyforge.org] framework.

== Description

Lazydoc allows you to define lazy attributes that access documentation in a
source file.

  # Sample::key <value>
  # This is the comment content.  A content
  # string can span multiple lines...
  class Sample
    extend Lazydoc::Attributes
    lazy_attr :key
  end
  
  comment = Sample::key
  comment.value      # => "<value>"
  comment.comment    # => "This is the comment content.  A content string can span multiple lines..."

Comments support wrapping, allowing for easy presentation:

  thirtydots = "\n#{'.' * 30}\n"
  
  "#{thirtydots}#{comment.wrap(30)}#{thirtydots}"
  # => %q{
  # ..............................
  # This is the comment content.
  # A content string can span
  # multiple lines...
  # ..............................
  # }

Lazydoc also provides helpers to register method documentation:

  class Helpers
    extend Lazydoc::Attributes
    
    lazy_register(:method_one)
    
    # method_one is registered whenever it 
    # gets defined
    def method_one(a, b='str', &c)
    end
    
    # register_caller will register the line
    # that *calls* method_two (see below)
    def method_two
      Lazydoc.register_caller
    end
  end
  
  # *THIS* is the line that gets
  # registered by method_two
  Helpers.const_attrs[:method_two] = Helpers.new.method_two
  
  one = Helpers.const_attrs[:method_one]
  one.resolve
  one.method_name            # => "method_one"
  one.arguments              # => ["a", "b='str'", "&c"]
  one.to_s                   # => "method_one is registered whenever it gets defined"
  
  two = Helpers.const_attrs[:method_two]
  two.resolve
  two.subject                # => "Helpers.const_attrs[:method_two] = Helpers.new.method_two"
  two.to_s                   # => "*THIS* is the line that gets registered by method_two"

Lazy accessors may be defined to access the registered lines more easily:

  class Helpers
    lazy_attr(:one, :method_one)
    lazy_attr(:two, :method_two)
  end
  
  Helpers.one.method_name    # => "method_one"
  Helpers.two.subject        # => "Helpers.const_attrs[:method_two] = Helpers.new.method_two"

== Usage

Lazydoc can find two types of documentation, constant attributes and code
comments.  The distinction is primarily how they are found and parsed; both
are represented by Comment objects.

=== Constant Attributes

Constant attributes are defined in the documentation to look like constants,
but with an extra 'key' that must consist of only lowercase letters and/or
underscores. For example, these are constant attributes:

  # Const::Name::key
  # Const::Name::key_with_underscores
  # ::key

While these are not:

  # Const::Name::Key
  # Const::Name::key2
  # Const::Name::k@y

Lazydoc parses a Lazydoc::Comment for each constant attribute by using the 
remainder of the line as a value (ie subject) and trailing lines as content.
Parsing continues until a non-comment line, an end key, or a new attribute
is reached; the comment is then stored by constant name and key.

  str = %Q{
  # Const::Name::key value for key
  # comment for key
  # parsed until a 
  # non-comment line

  # Const::Name::another value for another
  # comment for another
  # parsed to an end key
  # Const::Name::another-
  #
  # ignored comment
  }

  doc = Lazydoc::Document.new
  doc.resolve(str)

  doc.summarize {|c| [c.value, c.comment] } 
  # => {
  # 'Const::Name' => {
  #   'key' =>     ['value for key', 'comment for key parsed until a non-comment line'],
  #   'another' => ['value for another', 'comment for another parsed to an end key']}
  # }

Constant attributes are only parsed from comment lines. To turn off attribute
parsing for a section of documentation, use start/stop keys:

  str = %Q{
  Const::Name::not_parsed

  # :::-
  # Const::Name::not_parsed
  # :::+
  # Const::Name::parsed value
  }

  doc = Lazydoc::Document.new
  doc.resolve(str)
  doc.summarize {|comment| comment.value }   # => {'Const::Name' => {'parsed' => 'value'}}

To hide attributes from RDoc, make use of the RDoc <tt>:startdoc:</tt>
document modifier like this (note the modifiers have an extra space in them to
prevent RDoc from hiding the example):

  # :start doc::Const::Name::one hidden in RDoc
  # * This line is visible in RDoc.
  # :start doc::Const::Name::one-
  # 
  #-- 
  # Const::Name::two
  # You can hide attribute comments like this.
  # Const::Name::two-
  #++
  #
  # * This line is also visible in RDoc.

As a side note, the constant attribute syntax is designed to echo how the
Lazydoc::Attributes module makes comments accessible in code. In *very*
idiomatic Ruby 'Const::Name::key' is equivalent to the method call
'Const::Name.key'.

=== Code Comments

Code comments are lines registered for parsing if and when a Lazydoc gets
resolved. Unlike constant attributes, the registered line is the comment
subject (ie value) and the content consists of the preceding documentation
(basically mimicking the behavior of RDoc).

  str = %Q{
  # comment lines for
  # the method
  def method
  end

  # as in RDoc, the comment can be
  # separated from the method

  def another_method
  end
  }

  doc = Lazydoc::Document.new
  doc.register(3)
  doc.register(9)
  doc.resolve(str)

  doc.comments.collect {|c| [c.subject, c.comment] } 
  # => [
  # ['def method', 'comment lines for the method'],
  # ['def another_method', 'as in RDoc, the comment can be separated from the method']]

Comments may be registered to specific line numbers, or with a Proc or
Regexp that will determine the line number during resolution.  In the case
of a Regexp, the first matching line is used; Procs receive an array of
lines and should return the line number that should be used.  See 
{Comment#parse_up}[link://classes/Lazydoc/Comment.html] for more details.

Manually registering lines for documentation can be quite cumbersome. The
Lazydoc::Attributes module provides helpers to register method documentation
on classes with method-like inheritance.

  class A
    extend Lazydoc::Attributes
    lazy_attr(:one, :method_one)
    lazy_register(:method_one)
    
    # documentation for method one
    def method_one; end
  end
  
  class B < A
  end
  
  class C < B
    # overriding documentation for method one
    def method_one; end
  end
  
  A::one.comment    # => "documentation for method one"
  B::one.comment    # => "documentation for method one"
  C::one.comment    # => "overriding documentation for method one"
